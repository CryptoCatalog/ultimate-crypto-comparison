# mbed TLS - https://tls.mbed.org/
mbed TLS (formerly known as PolarSSL) makes it trivially easy for developers to include cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in their (embedded) products, facilitating this functionality with a minimal coding footprint.

## Description
mbed TLS offers an SSL library with an intuitive API and readable source code, so you can actually understand what the code does. Also the mbed TLS modules are as loosely coupled as possible and written in the portable C language. This allows you to use the parts you need, without having to include the total library
