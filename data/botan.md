# Botan - https://botan.randombit.net/
Botan is a BSD-licensed cryptographic library written in C++. It provides a wide variety of cryptographic algorithms, formats, and protocols, e.g. SSL and TLS. It is used in the Monotone distributed revision control program, the OpenDNSSEC system, and ISC's Kea DHCP server among other projects.

## License
- BSD-2-Clause

## Description
Botan's goal is to be the best option for cryptography in new C++ code by offering the tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems, such as TLS/DTLS, PKIX certificate handling, PKCS#11 and TPM hardware support, password hashing, and post quantum crypto schemes. In addition to the C++, botan has a C89 API specifically designed to be easy to call from other languages. A Python binding using ctypes is included, and several other language bindings are available.
