## Description
Botan's goal is to be the best option for cryptography in new C++ code by offering the tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems, such as TLS/DTLS, PKIX certificate handling, PKCS#11 and TPM hardware support, password hashing, and post quantum crypto schemes. In addition to the C++, botan has a C89 API specifically designed to be easy to call from other languages. A Python binding using ctypes is included, and several other language bindings are available.
