# HElib - http://shaih.github.io/HElib/
An Implementation of homomorphic encryption

## Description
HElib is a software library that implements homomorphic encryption (HE). Currently available is an implementation of the Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme, along with many optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation runs faster, focusing mostly on effective use of the Smart-Vercauteren ciphertext packing techniques and the Gentry-Halevi-Smart optimizations. See this report for a description of a few of the algorithms using in this library. Starting December 2014, the library also includes bootstrapping.
